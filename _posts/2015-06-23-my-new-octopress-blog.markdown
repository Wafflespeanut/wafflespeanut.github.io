I've been a wordpress blogger for over two years now. My previous blog [Arrow of time](https://wafflescrazypeanut.wordpress.com) was actually meant for writing about Physics (among other random stuff). It was a success, and I had a great time blogging. But nowadays, I'm more interested in code (than in Physics) and so, I think it's time to move on.

**Why this blog?** Because, Wordpress *sucks* when it comes to code-formatting! (just like many other blog providers). Plus, I've always wanted to use Github pages for blogging. And, nothing else can beat the beautiful [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)! So, here I am, with my new Jekyll-powered blog, where I'll be writing about my favorite times with code (mostly Python & Rust), which (I hope) will be interesting for everyone.

**What about the old blog?** Well, I'll still be using my old blog for posting random stuff though (if I get some free time).
